The comma is an operator in JavaScript that returns the last 
operand while evaluating all operands in an expression. The 
evaluation is from the left to right direction.

In a compound expression, the value of the rightmost operand 
is the outcome of the expression.

We use commas in for loop to give multiple parameters. The 
comma operator is completely different from commas in arrays, 
objects, arguments of a function, and parameters.

Example -
let x = 1;
(x++,x+=2,x*=3);

console.log(x) //Output: 12
